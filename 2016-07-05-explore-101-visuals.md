# Introduction

--

- Why think about visuals and design?
- How do you reuse existing images?
- How do you create new images?

---

# Why think about visuals and design?

--

## Where do you find stories about historic places?

- **Websites**: blogs, social media, slideshows
- **Exhibits**: signage, panels, table displays
- **Publications**: brochures, pamphlets, fliers

Good stories about places use both words and visuals.

--

## What visuals elements do stories use?

- Photographs
- Videos
- Graphics
- Drawings
- Maps

# How do you "design" the stories you create?

1. Learn the basic principles for design.
2. Recognize when you're not using them.
3. Apply the principles.

Note:

From the [Non-Designers Design Book](https://www.amazon.com/Non-Designers-Design-Book-4th/dp/0133966151) by Robin Williams.

## Design Principles

1. Proximity
2. Alignment
3. Repetition
4. Contrast

Note:

Where do you begin when you start to design?

- Start with the focal point
- Group your information into logical groups; decide on relationships between those groups; display relationships the closeness or lack of closeness (proximity) of the groups.
- As you arrange type and graphics on the page, create and maintain strong alignments.
- Create a repetition, or find items that have a repetitive connection.
- Unless you have chosen to create a concordant design, make sure you have strong contrasts that will attract a readers eye.

## How do you apply these design principles?

- Color
- Typography
- Layout
- Photography

---

## When do you start thinking about visuals?

Start thinking of visuals at the _beginning_ of your research and writing. Ask yourself:

- What is the best way to represent your story visually?
- Can you argue for the relevance of an image?
- Do captions add to the relevance to an image?

## Where can you get images?

- Images created by others that you **reuse**
- Images that you **create**

---

## Image Reuse

1. Finding images online
2. Reusing images the "right" way
3. Reading images like a historian

---

## How do you find images online?

Search digital collections _and_ collections of collections.

--

## What is the public domain?

>"A work of authorship is in the "public domain" if it is no longer under copyright protection or if it failed to meet the requirements for copyright protection. Works in the public domain may be used freely without the permission of the former copyright owner."

[Copright.gov](http://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-definitions.html)

--

## Attribution always matters

You are not _required_ to provide attribution when you reuse a work in the public domain but attribution us _always_ a good idea. Attribution (or a record of public domain works you use) can help you (or others) find works again later if necessary. Attributions typically includes:

- Source: Where did you get the image?
- Creator: Who created the image?
- Date: When was the image created?

--

## What other works are available for reuse?

Any work licensed with **Creative Commons** license may be reused with some restrictions.

## How do you "read" photographs?

Ask questions about the images you find:

1. Photographer (or creator)
2. Frame
3. Place
4. Time
5. Details and artifacts
6. Technical aspects

Note:

"Reading photographs is done best by systematically addressing quesions about them."

1. **Photographer:** "What did the photographer see when she took the picture? What is in the photograph that she possibly did not see? What were her purposes? What were her biases? Why did she pose people as she did? Why did she shoot from the vantage point the picture indicates? How did the circumstances in which the picture was taken limit the photographers choices?"
2. **Frame:** "The eye would have seen the subject of the picture differently, for it could not have drawn an arbitrary boundary around a section of the field of vision. What was omitted from the picture that the eye would have seen? What effect does the framing have on one's sense of having been there? How would one's reaction to the picture change if the picture were to be cropped—that is, to have its frame reduced further?""
3. **Place:** "Was it taken indoors? If so, what effect did the indoor setting have on the picture? Was it contrived or artificial? What clues does the camera provude to the cultural landscape? TO the natural landcsape? If the camera could have caught sounds and odors, how would the iage it captured have been enhanced?
4. **Time**: How does the photograph reveal the time of the day or year? What preceded the taking of the picture? What followed it? How does the picture reveal the stoppig of time? What is caught in motion? What does the picture reveal of the times in which it was taken?
5. **Details and artifacts**: What do the parts contribute to the whole? How does the picture enable you to interpret the details in it? How do the details help in drawing conclusions about the time and place of the event portrayed in the picture? What is revealed about the occupations, social class, tastes, beliefs, or values of the persons shown?
6. **Technical aspects**: What type of camera? What type of lens? What type of lighting?

Note:

About the Detroit Photographic Company

"The Detroit Photographic Company began as a photographic publishing firm in the late 1890s. The founders, Detroit businessman and publisher William A. Livingston, Jr., and photographer and photopublisher Edwin H. Husher, obtained the exclusive rights to use the Swiss color photolithography "Photochrom" process. This process permitted the mass production of color postcards, prints, and albums for sale to the American market. In 1897 William Henry Jackson became a partner in the firm, adding thousands of negatives to the inventory, some taken as early as the 1870s. In 1905 the company changed its name to the Detroit Publishing Company. It went into receivership in 1924, and liquidated its assets in 1932." via [Yale Library](http://beinecke.library.yale.edu/collections/highlights/detroit-photographic-company%E2%80%99s-views-north-america-ca-1897-1924)

### What does your visual show?

Note:

Example of views required from HABS/HAER:

- General or environmental view(s) to illustrate setting, including landscaping, adjacent building(s), and roadways.
- Front façade, with and without a scale stick.
- Perspective view, front and one side.
- Perspective view, rear and opposing side.
- Detail, front entrance and/or typical doorway
- Typical window.
- Exterior details, such as chimney, clerestory, oriel, date stone, gingerbread ornamentation, or boot scrape, indicative of era of construction or of historic and architectural interest.
- Interior views to capture spatial relationships, structural evidence, a typical room, and any decorative elements; these include hallways, stairways, attic and basement framing, fireplaces and mantels, moldings, interior shutters, kitchen (especially if original), and mechanicals.

From [National Register Photo Policy](https://www.nps.gov/Nr/publications/bulletins/photopolicy/Photo_Policy_update_2013_05_15.pdf):

- Submit photographs showing the principal facades and the setting in which the property is located.
- Additions, alterations, intrusions, and dependencies should appear in the photographs.
- Include views of interiors, outbuildings, landscaping, or unusual features if they contribute to the significance of the property.

## Make a slideshow

1. Use a variety of image types to provide a sense of pacing (wide, medium, details, portrait, action)
2. Each picture should have a purpose
3. Pictures shouldn't be redundant
4. Kill the puppies. Not every image is worth keeping
5. Know what story you want to tell, and plan accordingly
6. The first image should draw your reader into the story
