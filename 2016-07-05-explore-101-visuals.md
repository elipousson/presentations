# Using Images

- Think of the visuals from the beginning of researching and writing your story. What is the best way to represent your story visually?
- Can you argue for the relevance of the image?
- Do captions add to the relevance to the image?

## Common Myths about Image Reuse

- It's okay to use anything that's online as long as I give credit, because it is public. **FALSE**
- It's okay to use something if I asked for permission and didn't get a response, or don’t know who took a photo. **FALSE**
- It's okay to use anything as long as I'm not making any money off of it. **FALSE**

### What does your visual show?

Note:

Example of views required from HABS/HAER:

- General or environmental view(s) to illustrate setting, including landscaping, adjacent building(s), and roadways.
- Front façade, with and without a scale stick.
- Perspective view, front and one side.
- Perspective view, rear and opposing side.
- Detail, front entrance and/or typical doorway
- Typical window.
- Exterior details, such as chimney, clerestory, oriel, date stone, gingerbread ornamentation, or boot scrape, indicative of era of construction or of historic and architectural interest.
- Interior views to capture spatial relationships, structural evidence, a typical room, and any decorative elements; these include hallways, stairways, attic and basement framing, fireplaces and mantels, moldings, interior shutters, kitchen (especially if original), and mechanicals.

From [National Register Photo Policy](https://www.nps.gov/Nr/publications/bulletins/photopolicy/Photo_Policy_update_2013_05_15.pdf):

- Submit photographs showing the principal facades and the setting in which the property is located.
- Additions, alterations, intrusions, and dependencies should appear in the photographs.
- Include views of interiors, outbuildings, landscaping, or unusual features if they contribute to the significance of the property.

## Make a slideshow

1. Use a variety of image types to provide a sense of pacing (wide, medium, details, portrait, action)
2. Each picture should have a purpose
3. Pictures shouldn’t be redundant
4. Kill the puppies. Not every image is worth keeping
5. Know what story you want to tell, and plan accordingly
6. The first image should draw your reader into the story
