# Introduction

Note:

Here are all the spreadsheets and maps we may reference in this presentation:

- [Vacant Buildings - Historic Districts - Baltimore City](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fR7B9fbAblGgZVfb6_GFXeincgPruYjb5bWp811xLxs/edit?usp=sharing)

## Who is Baltimore Heritage?

Note:

Founded in 1960, Baltimore Heritage, Inc. is Baltimore’s nonprofit historic and architectural preservation organization. With two staff members, 33 volunteer board members, and a host of volunteers, we work to preserve and promote Baltimore’s historic buildings and neighborhoods.

## We use data for preservation advocacy

- How do we use data to support preservation advocacy on vacant housing?
- What tools and resources do we use to work with data?

--

## We use data to talk about vacancy, demolition, and Project CORE

- How are we using data in our work on Project CORE?
- How can other nonprofits and advocacy groups use data to investigate housing and community development issues?

Note:

How data can assist in preservation advocacy efforts?

- **at the "big picture" level**: what is happening? where is it happening? do we care about this? why do we care about this? how can we explain our concerns to our board, members, supporters, and partners?
- **at the building and block level**: where are the opportunities for advocacy? do we have specific concerns we need to address in the advocacy process?

--

## We needed to know more about vacancy and demolition

- How can we promote alternatives to demolition if we don't know where demolition is taking place?
- How can we argue for the feasibility of building reuse if we don't know where market conditions make reuse difficult?
- How can we encourage residents to participate in the review of demolition projects when information about projects is confusing or difficult to access?

**We can't.**

--

## We are learning more by asking questions

- What neighborhoods are most affected by vacancy and demolition?
- What vacant buildings are most likely to be selected for demolition?
- Where are the opportunities for Baltimore City or private developers to invest in stabilization, preservation, and reuse?

---

## What tools and resources do we use to work with data?

Note:

How do we approach working with data on vacancy and demolition?

- **Free tools**: QGIS, Carto (formerly CartoDB) with a free nonprofit account, Google Sheets, Socrata
- **Show our work**: Publishing blog posts, Facebook group posts, asking for feedback, questions, comments

--

## Free tools

- [CARTO](https://carto.com/)
- [QGIS](http://qgis.org/)
- [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/)

Note:

As a small nonprofit, we don't have a big budget for outside consultants or expensive software. Instead, we try to use free and open-source tools.

CARTO is a web-based platform for geographical data visualization and analysis. They offer a basic free plan to everyone and a [20% discount for students and nonprofits](https://carto.com/pricing/#discount).

QGIS is a free and open-source Geographic Information System desktop application. It may not be as pretty as ArcGIS but there is a lot of useful [documentation available online](http://qgis.org/en/docs/index.html).

We connect those two applications together using [a free plugin](https://github.com/gkudos/qgis-cartodb) that makes it easy to move data from QGIS to CARTO and back again. CARTO can also [work with ArcGIS](https://carto.com/blog/esri-and-cartodb-together/) for any planners or professional who use that application.

We also use Google Sheets, a free spreadsheet application included with Google Drive, to do both basic data analysis and to sync data from the Baltimore Open Data platform to CARTO.

For more on how we import data from Socrata into Google Sheets and sync Google Sheets with CARTO, see ["How to create a property information system for your neighborhood"](http://elipousson.github.io/data/2016/06/06/property-information-system-neighborhood/) by Eli Pousson.

## Show our work

- Baltimore Heritage account on Open Baltimore
- Posting on Baltimore's New Old House Forum and Bmore Historic
- Making data available with Google Sheets and GitHub

Note:

We also think it is important to show our work and clearly document our process so any interested stakeholders can see how we conducted our analysis.

To achieve this goal, we have been regularly sharing the data, maps, and visualizations we have created over the past six months through online communities related to housing and historic preservation in Baltimore. By sharing our work, we have been able to get immediate feedback from residents and partners to help shape our approach and presentation.

We also want to be transparent about data sources and share any data we get in formats that people can use. We are already using Google Sheets to do this and experimenting with using GitHub.

## How did we approach our analysis?

- **Place**: Distribution, proximity
- **Time**: Trends, patterns, etc.

--

## Place

Note:

- Geographic distribution within:
	- neighborhoods
	- historic districts
	- market typology

--

## Time

Note:

- Patterns of change over time:
	- demolition permits
	- historic tax credits

--

## Charts

--

## Maps

Note:

Explain how we did the analysis:

- Google Sheets
- QGIS (w/ CartoDB connector)

Explain how we visualized the analysis:

- Google Charts (boo!)
- Google Sheets (yay?)
- Chartbuilder (yay?)
- CartoDB (yay!!)

### What do we get out of using data in our advocacy?

- **More effective advocacy**: Fight where our help is needed and wanted. Fight for what matters. Fight where we can actually make a difference.
- **Greater resident participation**: Use data to help make the process more accessible and engaging to residents (both people who support preservation and those who want to see more demolition)

## Helping people to participate

Note:

Our goal with a new Preservation Maryland funded project through the Community Law Center is to develop a workshop and toolkit for community groups in historic districts to ...

Note:

Where did we get our data?

What is the proportion of landuse in Baltimore historic districts? How does that compare to the city as a whole?

What is the timeline for Baltimore's historic district designations?
