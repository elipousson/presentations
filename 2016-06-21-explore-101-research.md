## How to research historic places in Baltimore
### Explore Baltimore Heritage 101

Eli Pousson, [Baltimore Heritage](http://baltimoreheritage.org/) | June 21, 2016

Note: In this presentation, we decided to focus on helping learners understand the research process and the analytical framework used by local historians rather than focusing on how to access to analyze specific sources (like maps or newspapers).

We also put together a series of **activities** that learners can do on their own or in groups to increase their familiarity with how to use specific types of sources or specific databases.

The finished version of this presentation will be published on the [Explore Baltimore Heritage 101 course site](http://baltimoreheritage.github.io/explore-101/).

# Introduction

Note: This presentation has two parts.

--

## Research + Historic Places

- What kinds of places can you research?
- How do you think like a historian?
- How do you ask and answer questions about places?

Note: Let's start by **thinking about the process of researching historic places**.

--

## Making Sense of Sources

- What sources are available for local history?
- How do you search for sources?
- How do you make sense of the evidence you find?

Note: Then, we can tackle the process of **how to research historic places** in more detail.

---

# Research + Historic Places

---

## What kinds of places can you research?

1. Individual buildings
2. Groups of buildings
3. Landscapes
4. Public art and monuments

Note: Thinking about historic places in terms of a typology can help you understand the similarities and differences between a place and comparable places. Some historians call groups of buildings as "assemblages" of buildings. These categories are based on the [Vernacular Architecture Forum downloadable slideshow](http://www.vernaculararchitectureforum.org/Tools-for-Education).

Note: **Individual buildings** include houses, commercial buildings, and factories. Other individual structures could include bridges, tunnels, or dams. Also – this image is a different ratio than all the others and should be swapped out or re-cropped.

Note: **Groups of buildings** include row house blocks, a row of commercial buildings on a "main street", or a complex of buildings like a church with a parsonage and school.

## What makes places different?

How are places shaped by different factors?

- **physical context** (rural, suburban, urban)
- **use** (agricultural, commercial, domestic, and industrial)
- **age** (very old or very new)

--

## What place do you want to research?

Write it down. Let's talk about it.

Note: **Activity: What kind of place do you want to research?**

Before the activity, the facilitator will set up a poster board divided into four quadrants for the four categories of places described above. Then, follow the steps below:

1. Write the name and location of a place you want to research on a post-it note. If you have more than one place in mind, please use a new post-it note for each place.
2. Put the post-it notes on the post board in the category where you think they belong. How many post-its are in each category?
3. Think again about the place you want to research. How can you look at an individual building as part of a group or as part of a landscape?
4. Write a second post-it note that incorporates the place you are interested in but places it in another category than the first one.

---

## How do historians think about the past?

Note: It is helpful to consider how historians think about the past and how we can understand the past. We think it is also important to look at what makes local history different than scholarly or academic history.

--

### Five C's of Historical Thinking

What _habits of mind_ do historians use?

- Change over time
- Context
- Causality
- Contingency
- Complexity

Note: These concepts (created by Thomas Andrews and Flannery Burke) are designed to help you "formulate and support arguments based on primary sources" and "understand and challenge historical interpretations related in secondary sources". This isn't the only way to think about historical thinking but it is a helpful framework for explaining core concepts.

Read more about the five C's of historical thinking in [What Does It Mean to Think Historically?](https://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/january-2007/what-does-it-mean-to-think-historically)

**Activity: Source Analysis** You can use these concepts to assist in the analysis of a historical document or source.  See the [Document Analysis Worksheets](http://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/worksheets/index.html) from the National Archives for more information.

TODO: Think of more examples to fill in the slides in this section.

### How do local historians think about the past?

Local historians often have different goals than academic historians. Your goal does not need to be complicated:

> "Often the goal of inquiry is simply an accurate portrayal of of an event, personality, set of conditions, or place at some past moment."
> — David Kyvig and Myron Marty, [Nearby History](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL2987596W/Nearby_History) (2000)

--

### What kind of questions do local historians ask?

Common research topics for local historians range from intimate subjects like _family_ to more distant subjects like _cities_:

- **Families**: relationships, movement, daily life, public affairs, education
- **Residences**: physical features, ownership, use
- **Neighborhoods**: boundaries, identity, transportation, population
- **Organizations**: businesses, schools, religious groups, voluntary associations
- **Cities**: society, economy, justice, health government

Note: These are the categories that David Kyvig and Myron Marty suggest to categorize research questions.

--

## How do you ask good questions about the past?

Often your challenge is _not_ coming up with a topic or a question. It is deciding what topics _you_ care about.

> Nearly everyone is surrounded by a vast assortment of people, objects, and institutions, each with potentially interesting past about which an enormous amount of information exists in one form or another.
> — David Kyvig and Myron Marty, [Nearby History](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL2987596W/Nearby_History) (2000)

--

### How do you answer good questions about the past?

An answer to your question is the goal of your research:

- A description of the past
- Measurement of change over time
- An analysis of cause and consequence

Note: Kyvig and Marty suggest that historical questions should have answers that include these three elements.

--

## What questions do you want to ask?

Share your questions with your neighbors.

Note: **Activity**: What do my neighbors think?

1. Think of a research question about a historic places in your neighborhood.
2. Share the research question on a neighborhood Facebook group, email listserv, or

## How did historians think about places in the past?

![The Belvedere Hotel, 1 East Chase Street, Baltimore, MD, January 13, 2011](https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5085/5368889506_3abc491639_b.jpg)

Note: In the past, architectural historians have often focused on the well-known individual architects or the design of ornate buildings (sometimes known as **high-style buildings**).

--

## How do historians think about places today?

Today, many historians interested in buildings study **"vernacular architecture"**—the common buildings that make up most neighborhoods and cities.

--

### What is vernacular architecture?

> Vernacular architecture is the common building of a given place and time.
> — Eric Mercer, English Vernacular Houses (1975)

Note: Using this flexible definition, historians Thomas Carter and Elizabeth Collins Cromley in [Invitation to Vernacular Architecture](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL17343095W/Invitation_to_Vernacular_Architecture) (2005) suggest organizing your research around the _kind of community_ you are looking at, rather than the specific characteristics of a building.

--

### How do you look at places in communities?

- **Local**: A single location
- **Regional**: Grouping nearby locations with shared cultural traits
- **National**: Cultural patterns defined by national affinities
- **International**: Cultural cores and their peripheries
- **Global**: Worldwide diffusion of culture

Note: Carter and Cromley divide "vernacular communities" into five categories based on size and scale. These categories are _not_ mutually exclusive.

# Making Sense of Sources

Note: At the center of the research process are the sources you use to understand the past. Historians talk about sources as documents to be read literally and metaphorically. Historians also talk about sources as evidence to support an argument.

- Expectations
- Availability
- Search
- Analysis

---

## What is a source?

Sources (also known to historians as "documents" or "evidence") are how we learn about the past.

- Sources are created by people.
- Sources always come from a place and time.
- Almost anything can be a source.
- Some sources are more useful than others.
- What makes a source useful is how you use it.
- Questions and sources work and change together.

Note: Adapted from [What are the Documents?](http://www.williamcronon.net/researching/documents.htm)

--

## How do questions and sources work together?

Note: Research is an iterative process and your questions depend on available time and sources.

> You will go through many of the same steps again and again. You will have to read documents, pursue interesting ideas, read some more, create more questions, find documents, and so on. Continue doing this until you reach a question that is small enough that you think you could answer it in the time available to you.

From [How to Frame a Researchable Question](http://www.williamcronon.net/researching/questions.htm)

---

## What sources are available for local history?

![Buildings leave a trail of evidence](/presentations/images/2016-06-21-buildings-leave-evidence.png)

Note: Here are some of the sources available:

- Public Records and Documents
- Periodicals
- Maps
- Images
- Manuscript and Artifact Collections
- Scientific and Quantitative Data
- Interviews
- Buildings and Landscapes

Adapted from [What are the Documents?](http://www.williamcronon.net/researching/documents.htm)

--

## What sources are most useful for local history?

1. Public records and documents
2. Newspapers
3. Maps

## How do you search for sources?

We are going to focus on using keywords to search through digitized text-based sources (like newspapers or digitized books).

- Different sources are organized in different ways.
- Finding what you are looking for require different strategies.

--

## What

---

## How can places be used as a source?

There are five main approaches for analyzing vernacular architecture:

- Time
- Space
- Form
- Function
- Technology

Note: Research isn't just about finding sources or collecting evidence. Research is about **analysis** when you try to answer your research questions. These approaches are the "point at which the architectural and archival evidence join to reveal the **patterns of behavior** that are the goal of the research process." They require you to combine different kinds of evidence:

> "These two bodies of evidence—words and things—interweave to yield a composite portrait of the patterns of behavior we seek to uncover."

See Carter and Cromley, p. 45-47 for more.

---

## How do you make sense of the evidence you find?

---

## How do you search for sources?

- Thinking about sources
- Determine what sources are **available** and **relevant**
- Develop a **search strategy** based around search queries or keywords
- Evaluate the **credibility** of your sources continuously

--

### Searching with key words

How to come up with key words:

- Write your research questions
- Turn research questions into keywords
- Choose nouns instead of verbs (sometimes)

How to search with keywords:

- Start with general keywords
- Try new combinations systematically
- Use more precise terms as you progress
- Pair primary keywords serially with secondary keywords

What do you do if your first choice doesn't work?

# Activities

One way to practice and develop your local history research skills is by contributing to a larger crowd-sourced project:

- [History Unfolded](https://newspapers.ushmm.org/), U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum: Build your expertise in finding events in historic newspaper databases by volunteering to research how local newspapers covered the Holocaust and then submit the articles you find to the History Unfolded online database.
- [Building Inspector](http://buildinginspector.nypl.org/), New York Public Library Labs: Build your understanding of historical atlases by volunteering as a citizen cartographers for the New York Public Library identifying buildings and other details on beautiful old maps

Another way to practice is

- [Two Houses Diverged in a Neighborhood](https://gist.github.com/elipousson/e742d3efbf1d620d3b196b76b6a132c5), Eli Pousson


---

## How do you think about the research process?

One way of looking at the research process is the Stripling Model of Inquiry:

1. Wonder: How do you come up with a question?
2. Investigate: How do you search for sources?
3. Construct: How do you use primary sources?
4. Express: How do you share your research?
5.  Reflect: How do you ask new questions?
6. Connect: How do you put your research in context?

Note: There are many different ways to describe the research process. These categories are based on the [Stripling Model of Inquiry](http://loc.gov/teachers/tps/quarterly/inquiry_learning/pdf/StriplingModelofInquiry.pdf).

## What makes local history a bit different?

Secondary sources:

- Maybe there has been little or nothing written about your particular topic. So you may need to look for comparable examples — e.g. are there histories of other cemeteries established around the same time? Are there histories of other people who lived in a neighborhood?

Primary sources:

- Maybe sources on the building are difficult to locate. Built outside the city before the creation of Sanborn maps for that area, or occupied by residents who did not attract much attention from newspaper reporters.

Searching full-text sources makes local history possible in new ways.

## What sources are we looking at?

Focus on searching full-text digitized sources:

If you know the author or title of the book you are looking for, searching the catalog by author or title (rather than keyword) is usually the quickest way to find it.

If you do not know the exact title of the book you are looking for, try searching for the book on Amazon.Amazon will give you the book's exact title, which you can then use to search for the book in your library's catalog.

To find all the books in the library by a given author, browse by the author's last name or click on the author's name in the catalog record for a book.

Most library catalogs allow you to search by “keyword” or “words anywhere.” This search finds catalog records that include your search term anywhere in the title, subject, author, or other fields. It is not foolproof, however. Besides the fact that you must spell the term exactly as it is spelled in the catalog, catalog records are very short—so short that they cannot include all of the major terms related to a book's subject. This kind of search may also give you results that happen to include all the words you used, but are not about your topic.

To search for two or more words as a connected phrase, put the phrase in quotation marks. A search for “Yellowstone National Park” will only find records that include that exact phrase. It would not return results with “Yellowstone Park” or another variation.

Most library catalogs use ? or \* as wildcards or truncation symbols. If you shorten a word using a truncation symbol, the catalog will find all variants of that word. A search for “wol?,” for example, will return records that include wolf, wolves, and wolverines—as well as wold, wolds, and wolfawitz.

Use Boolean operators—and, or, but not—to broaden or narrow your search. A search for wolves and Yellowstone will only find catalog records that include both terms, while a search for wolves or Yellowstone will find all the records that include either term. A search for Yellowstone but not tourism will retrieve all the records on Yellowstone except those that include the word tourism.

---

Bibliographies

This is the most effective—and efficient—research technique. If you use the first sources you find to uncover other sources, you will write a much stronger paper than you will if you find all of your sources through keyword searches.

Why? Because tracking down the books and articles that your sources cite will propel you into the middle of a conversation about your topic. As you come to understand how various writers have interpreted your topic—how they respond to, revise, or disagree with each other—you will figure out exactly what you want to contribute.

# More on the 5Cs



### Change over time


Note: "As historians of the American West and environmental historians, we often turn to maps to teach change over time. The same space represented in different ways as political power, economic structures, and cultural influences shift can often put in shocking relief the differences that time makes."

--

### Context

Note: "Working with primary sources, they discover that the past makes more sense when they set it within two frameworks. In our teaching, we liken the first to the floating words that roll across the screen at the beginning of every Star Warsfilm. This kind of context sets the stage; the second helps us to interpret evidence concerning the action that ensues. Texts, events, individual lives, collective struggles—all develop within a tightly interwoven world."

--

### Causality

Note: "To teach causality, we have turned to the stand-by activities of the history classroom: debates and role-playing. After arming students with primary sources, we ask them to argue whether monetary or fiscal policy played a greater role in causing the Great Depression. After giving students descriptions drawn from primary sources of immigrant families in Los Angeles, we have asked students to take on the role of various family members and explain their reasons for immigrating and their reasons for settling in particular neighborhoods. Neither exercise is especially novel, but both fulfill a central goal of studying history: to develop persuasive explanations of historical events and processes based on logical interpretations of evidence."
