## What is the _problem_ with preservation in Legacy Cities?

Note:

Ned Kaufman has argued that preservation policy developed around controlled growth:

>The system addressed growth in two interconnected ways: regulation, or the power to say no; and design, or the power to say yes. For the landmarks law allowed the commission to negotiate design changes with applicants, with the goal of arriving at proposals that could be approved. As a result, developers and architects learned how to mold growth into acceptable shapes. Thus the powers of Yes and No sometimes resist and sometimes shape growth but always work with it: without development pressure, indeed, the system would not function.

## What is the Preservation Rightsizing Network?

Note:

The Preservation Rightsizing Network addresses the urgent issue of **rightsizing** in American legacy cities and neighborhoods. It brings together planners, preservation advocates, land banks, community development organizations, and other community stakeholders to develop and share practical tools for constructively engaging in and influencing local planning processes and local strategies. Our goal is to create more livable communities and lay a foundation for the revitalization of older and historic cities and neighborhoods.

## How do we do historic preservation in Legacy Cities?

Note:

- Buildings are potential assets but can be seen as eyesores.
- Preservationists being left out of conversations about neighborhood revitalization.
- We have some tools but we need more.
- We can’t do it alone. We need to expand our partnerships.
- Legacy cities are innovating – but where is the historic preservation movement?
- We needed a forum to share and learn from one another

## How do we get _better_ at historic preservation in Legacy Cities?

Note:

PRN was created to respond to a significant shift in the way of looking at legacy cities that included these very large-scale responses.

Preservation field as a whole: we need to adapt if we want to be a part of this conversation about the future of legacy cities.

These shifts aren’t foreign to preservation—they’re baked into the beginning of the movement—but they haven’t been at the forefront of the field.

And we need to get them there.

- Buildings→blocks and neighborhoods, with different tools (large-scale policies)
- Integrity→stories.
- Recognize NH integrity has been impacted by v. discriminatory policies, esp in low-income communities of color
- 50+ years→recent past + present.
- Engage new communities
- Reactive→proactive
- Add equity in a meaningful way
- Community engagement

PRN emerged to articulate a few principles—most are not new, but bringing them to the forefront and using different language in highly challenging + urgent situations:

- Focus on people and places
- Historic districts and older neighborhoods
- Community driven
- Equity
- Highly collaborative: we aren’t making the decisions in most cases, so who can we partner with to ensure our ideas get to the table.
- Pragmatic and flexible: Creative ways of getting things done (data collection, targeted and proactive code enforcement, rehab loans, etc.)

![Cleveland workshop, 2014.](/presentations/images/2014-cleveland-workshop.jpg)

Note:

In 2014, fifty people met in Cleveland to turn conversation into action.:

- Focused effort to come out of the conference with action—really visionary approach to conference organizing, to not just say, “Great conversations! Let us know how they go!” but to give a jumpstart to what comes next.
- 50 people from wide variety of professional fields and job types

What happened at the workshop?

- Large-group discussions about challenges and ideas
- Roundtable exercises to develop lists of priority actions
- Synthesizing them in a large group
- Came out with top 10 list on a whiteboard, then assigned responsibility to people and organizations who were there—and who weren’t (so potential allies)

## What is the Action Agenda?

--

![Tour of Newark industrial building, 2015 December 8.](/presentations/images/2015-12-08-newark-tour.jpg)

Note:

The agenda proposes nine action items for preservation in legacy cities as part of a comprehensive and effective approach. The action items are grouped under three themes:

- shaping a new approach to preservation,
- adapting existing preservation tools and policies,
- and supporting place-based collaboration.

Each theme acknowledges that historic preservation is not the foremost concern in distressed neighborhoods.

Each emphasizes that limited resources require setting practical priorities.

And each recognizes that the preservation field has substantial work to do.

--

## What do we do _next_?

!["What's your idea?" – Suggestion box displayed at the Detroit Historical Museum. Photograph by Eli Pousson, 2016 September 14.](/presentations/images/2016-09-14-your-idea-detroit.jpg)

Note:

Legacy cities: a very exciting place to work!

- Movement broad, both in terms of discipline and geography.
- Most cities have distressed neighborhoods and face challenges of persistent vacancy with some buildings.
- The work done in Detroit or Cleveland or Baltimore can lead to breakthroughs in hot-market cities—and vice versa.
