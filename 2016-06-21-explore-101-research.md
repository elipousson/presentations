## How to research historic places in Baltimore
### Explore Baltimore Heritage 101

Eli Pousson, [Baltimore Heritage](http://baltimoreheritage.org/) | June 21, 2016

Note: In this presentation, we decided to focus on helping learners understand the research process and the analytical framework used by local historians rather than focusing on how to access to analyze specific sources (like maps or newspapers).

We also put together a series of **activities** that learners can do on their own or in groups to increase their familiarity with how to use specific types of sources or specific databases.

The finished version of this presentation will be published on the [Explore Baltimore Heritage 101 course site](http://baltimoreheritage.github.io/explore-101/).

# Introduction

Note: This presentation has two parts.

--

## Research + Historic Places

- What kinds of places can you research?
- How do you think like a historian?
- How do you ask and answer questions about places?

Note: Let's start by **thinking about the process of researching historic places**.

--

## Making Sense of Sources

- What sources are available for local history?
- How do you search for sources?
- How do you make sense of the evidence you find?

Note: Then, we can tackle the process of **how to research historic places** in more detail.

---

# Research + Historic Places

---

## What kinds of places can you research?

1. Individual buildings
2. Groups of buildings
3. Landscapes
4. Public art and monuments

Note: Thinking about historic places in terms of a typology can help you understand the similarities and differences between a place and comparable places. Some historians call groups of buildings as "assemblages" of buildings. These categories are based on the [Vernacular Architecture Forum downloadable slideshow](http://www.vernaculararchitectureforum.org/Tools-for-Education).

Note: **Individual buildings** include houses, commercial buildings, and factories. Other individual structures could include bridges, tunnels, or dams. Also – this image is a different ratio than all the others and should be swapped out or re-cropped.

Note: **Groups of buildings** include row house blocks, a row of commercial buildings on a "main street", or a complex of buildings like a church with a parsonage and school.

## What makes places different?

What characteristics make one place different than another?

- **physical context**: rural, suburban, urban
- **use**: agricultural, commercial, domestic, and industrial
- **age**: old or new

--

## What place do you want to research?

Write it down. Let's talk about it.

Note: **Activity: What kind of place do you want to research?**

Before the activity, the facilitator will set up a poster board divided into four quadrants for the four categories of places described above. Then, follow the steps below:

1. Write the name and location of a place you want to research on a post-it note. If you have more than one place in mind, please use a new post-it note for each place.
2. Put the post-it notes on the post board in the category where you think they belong. How many post-its are in each category?
3. Think again about the place you want to research. How can you look at an individual building as part of a group or as part of a landscape?
4. Write a second post-it note that incorporates the place you are interested in but places it in another category than the first one.

## How do historians think about the past?

Note: It is helpful to consider how historians think about the past and how we can understand the past. We think it is also important to look at what makes local history different than scholarly or academic history.

--

### Five C's of Historical Thinking

What _habits of mind_ do historians use?

- Change over time
- Context
- Causality
- Contingency
- Complexity

Note: These concepts (created by Thomas Andrews and Flannery Burke) are designed to help you "formulate and support arguments based on primary sources" and "understand and challenge historical interpretations related in secondary sources". This isn't the only way to think about historical thinking but it is a helpful framework for explaining core concepts.

Read more about the five C's of historical thinking in [What Does It Mean to Think Historically?](https://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/january-2007/what-does-it-mean-to-think-historically)

**Activity: Source Analysis** You can use these concepts to assist in the analysis of a historical document or source.  See the [Document Analysis Worksheets](http://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/worksheets/index.html) from the National Archives for more information.

TODO: Think of more examples to fill in the slides in this section.

### How do local historians think about the past?

Local historians often have different goals than academic historians. Your goal does not need to be complicated:

> "Often the goal of inquiry is simply an accurate portrayal of of an event, personality, set of conditions, or place at some past moment."

Note: From David Kyvig and Myron Marty, [Nearby History](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL2987596W/Nearby_History) (2000)_

--

### How do local historians focus their research?

- **Families**: relationships, movement, daily life, public affairs, education
- **Residences**: physical features, ownership, use
- **Neighborhoods**: boundaries, identity, transportation, population
- **Organizations**: businesses, schools, religious groups, voluntary associations
- **Cities**: society, economy, justice, health government

Note: Common research topics for local historians range from intimate subjects like _family_ to more distant subjects like _cities_. These are the categories that David Kyvig and Myron Marty suggest to categorize research questions.

--

## How do you ask good questions about the past?

Often your challenge is _not_ coming up with a topic or a question. It is deciding what topics _you_ care about.

> Nearly everyone is surrounded by a vast assortment of people, objects, and institutions, each with potentially interesting past about which an enormous amount of information exists in one form or another.

_From David Kyvig and Myron Marty, [Nearby History](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL2987596W/Nearby_History) (2000)_

--

### How do you answer good questions about the past?

An answer to your question is the goal of your research:

- A description of the past
- Measurement of change over time
- An analysis of cause and consequence

Note: Kyvig and Marty suggest that historical questions should have answers that include these three elements.

--

## What questions do you want to ask?

Share your questions with your neighbors.

Note: **Activity**: What do my neighbors think?

1. Think of a research question about a historic places in your neighborhood.
2. Share the research question on a neighborhood Facebook group, email listserv, or

## How did historians think about places in the past?

![The Belvedere Hotel, 1 East Chase Street, Baltimore, MD, January 13, 2011](https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5085/5368889506_3abc491639_b.jpg)

Note: In the past, architectural historians have often focused on the well-known individual architects or the design of ornate buildings (sometimes known as **high-style buildings**).

--

## How do historians think about places today?

Today, many historians interested in buildings study **"vernacular architecture"**: the common buildings that make up most neighborhoods and cities.

--

### What is vernacular architecture?

> Vernacular architecture is the common building of a given place and time.

_~ Eric Mercer, English Vernacular Houses (1975)_

Note: Using this flexible definition, historians Thomas Carter and Elizabeth Collins Cromley in [Invitation to Vernacular Architecture](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL17343095W/Invitation_to_Vernacular_Architecture) (2005) suggest organizing your research around the _kind of community_ you are looking at, rather than the specific characteristics of a building.

--

### How do you look at places in communities?

- **Local**: A single location
- **Regional**: Grouping nearby locations with shared cultural traits
- **National**: Cultural patterns defined by national affinities
- **International**: Cultural cores and their peripheries
- **Global**: Worldwide diffusion of culture

Note: Carter and Cromley divide "vernacular communities" into five categories based on size and scale. These categories are _not_ mutually exclusive.

# Making Sense of Sources

Note: At the center of the research process are the sources you use to understand the past. Historians talk about sources as documents to be read literally and metaphorically. Historians also talk about sources as evidence to support an argument.

- Expectations
- Availability
- Search
- Analysis

---

## What is a source?

- Sources are created by people.
- Sources always come from a place and time.
- Almost anything can be a source.
- Some sources are more useful than others.
- What makes a source useful is how you use it.

Note: Sources (also known to historians as "documents" or "evidence") are how we learn about the past.

Adapted from [What are the Documents?](http://www.williamcronon.net/researching/documents.htm)

--

## What do you do with sources?

- Determine what sources are **available** and **relevant**
- Develop a **search strategy** based around search queries or keywords
- Evaluate the **credibility** of your sources

--

## How do questions and sources work together?

Note: Research is an iterative process and your questions depend on available time and sources.

> You will go through many of the same steps again and again. You will have to read documents, pursue interesting ideas, read some more, create more questions, find documents, and so on. Continue doing this until you reach a question that is small enough that you think you could answer it in the time available to you.

From [How to Frame a Researchable Question](http://www.williamcronon.net/researching/questions.htm)

## What sources are available for local history?

![Buildings leave a trail of evidence](/presentations/images/2016-06-20-buildings-trail-evidence.png)

Note: Adapted from [What are the Documents?](http://www.williamcronon.net/researching/documents.htm)

--

## What sources are available for local history?

- Public Records and Documents
- Periodicals
- Maps
- Images
- Manuscript and Artifact Collections
- Scientific and Quantitative Data
- Interviews
- Buildings and Landscapes

--
## How do you search for sources?

- Different sources are organized in different ways.
- Finding what you are looking for require different strategies.
- Generate search terms around

Note: We are going to focus on using keywords to search through digitized text-based sources (like newspapers or digitized books).

---

## How do you search for sources with keywords?

Keywords can  be:

- Toponyms (names of places)
- Locations (street names, addresses)
- Uses (name of a related business or activity)
- People (name of related individuals)
- Events (e.g. dedication, ground-breaking, etc.)

--

### Public Records and Documents

--

### Newspapers

--

### Maps

---

### Searching with key words

How to come up with key words:

- Write your research questions
- Turn research questions into keywords
- Choose nouns instead of verbs (sometimes)

How to search with keywords:

- Start with general keywords
- Try new combinations systematically
- Use more precise terms as you progress
- Pair primary keywords serially with secondary keywords

What do you do if your first choice doesn't work?

## Practice Research Skills

One way to practice and develop your local history research skills is by contributing to a larger crowd-sourced project:

- [History Unfolded](https://newspapers.ushmm.org/), U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum: Build your expertise in finding events in historic newspaper databases by volunteering to research how local newspapers covered the Holocaust and then submit the articles you find to the History Unfolded online database.
- [Building Inspector](http://buildinginspector.nypl.org/), New York Public Library Labs: Build your understanding of historical atlases by volunteering as a citizen cartographers for the New York Public Library identifying buildings and other details on beautiful old maps
