## Introduction

- Why does outreach matter for historic places?
- How do you use "interpretation" for outreach?
- What kinds of outreach can you do for historic places?

---

## What is outreach?

Outreach is a form of **communication**.

A story about a historic place is a way to **talk to people** in Baltimore and outside of Baltimore.

Outreach around historic places is sometimes known as **interpretation**.

Note:

- Why do you want to communicate with the community?  (What’s your purpose?)
- Whom do you want to communicate it to?  (Who’s your audience?)
- What do you want to communicate?  (What’s your message?)
- How do you want to communicate it?  (What communication channels will you use?)
- Whom should you contact and what should you do in order to use those channels?  (How will you actually distribute your message?)

## Why do you want to reach people?

>People will only care _for_ what they first care _about_.
~ National Park Service, 2012

Note:

What is the **purpose** of your outreach?

- Preservation
- Education
- Entertainment

Interpretation usually serves three main goals:

- Enhancing experiences
- Facilitating appreciation
- Influencing behavior

- What are your goals? Are you an organization or an individual?
	- Build or sustain an organization
	- Encourage specific action
	- Communicate knowledge
	- Create or reinforce values, ideas, or beliefs

--

## Who are you trying to reach?

**Over 2,700,00 people** live in the Baltimore area. Who do you want to talk to? Who do you want to listen to?

Note:

You may be trying to reach:

- a few people or many people;
- a group of people that are already organized or a group of people that are not organized.
- people who already know about the place or people who don't know about it.

Think about your audience as people you want to talk to and listen to. How do they think about their:

- Identity: e.g. age, race, gender, ethnicity
- Geography: where people work, where they live, where they are from?
- Employment
- Behaviors: Are you trying to reach people who engage in a particular activity?
- Attitudes: Are you trying to change people's minds?

--

## How do you reach people?

- Personal conversations
- Publications
- Public programs
- Websites
- Social media

Note:

- How do you reach out to people?
	- One on one conversations (Talk to people)
	- Publications (Give people something to read)
	- Public programs (Talk to groups of people)
	- Web (Give people something to engage with online)

A lot of outreach around historic places is for **noncaptive audiences**.

**Activity 1**

## What is interpretation?

People who work with historic sites talk about public programs, publications, and even websites as **interpretation**.

Note:

What is not interpretation?

- Marketing
- Fundraising
- Promoting events

Thinking about interpretation is useful to thinking about how we talk about historic places.

--

## How do you plan "good" interpretation?

Sam Ham argues that "good" interpretation:

- has a **theme**
- is **organized**
- is **relevant**
- is **enjoyable**

Note: Sam Ham uses the acronym TORE for short.

--

## Do you have a theme?

Your theme is the answer to the **"so what?" question**.

Note:

- Themes are not topics: a theme captures a single whole idea
- Themeless interpretation is doomed to infotainment (e.g. "Fun Facts" about architecture); a theme not only tells you where to start, it tells you when you're done
- "The story's the thing" (Tilden, 1957)
- Your theme answers the "so what?" question (a.k.a. the big picture, the moral to the story)
- Makes your job easier: "gives you a clear view of the information you should include and exclude"; "makes it a lot easier for you to research your topic and gather information"; Bill Lewis (1980): "if you have a clear theme in mind, you'll find that most everything else will fall into place."

## Are you organized?

Probability that a noncaptive audience will pay attention = Reward (potential benefit) / Effort (amount of work required)

--

## Is your interpretation relevant?

Relevant information has two qualities:

- meaningful
- personal

--

### What makes interpretation meaningful?

You can help people make meaning by **connecting unfamiliar and familiar ideas**. Useful tools for making these connections include:

- examples
- analogies
- contrasts
- similes
- metaphors

Note:

"Common everyday things make the best bridges."

--

### What makes information personal?

People care when you connect the information to something they _care_ about; not just something they _know_ about.

What do people care about?

Note:

NPS (Larsen, 2003) advanced idea of universal concepts:

- Emotions: love, hate, fear, elation, sorrow
- Basic biological imperatives: birth, death, hunger, thirst
- Human fascinations: uncertainty, cosmos, mystery, suspense

--

## Is your interpretation enjoyable?

Note:

To be entertaining or engaging, interpretation must be enjoyable and organized and relevant.

## How do you evaluate the success of a website or social media?

- **Reach**: People who read or see your website.
- **Engagement**: People who interact (likes, comments, shares) with your website.
- **Action**: People who take some action such as signing up for an email list or signing a petition.

Note:

Goals should be SMART:

- Specific: Who, what, where, when, and why?
- Measurable: They should include numbers and figures.
- Attainable: Your goal should present a challenge, but not be impossible.
- Relevant: Does your website goal fit with your overall marketing and business goals?
- Time-bound: Do you want to reach this goal in a week? Six months? A year?
