### Explore Baltimore Heritage 101

Eli Pousson, [Baltimore Heritage](http://baltimoreheritage.org/) | June 28, 2016

Note:

- How do you make evidence-based claims?
  - Discuss the importance of connecting claims to evidence
  - Activity 1: Identify claims in historical writing and locate sources
- How do you write a story with a beginning, middle, and an end?
  - Discuss the importance of narrative to engaging historical writing
  - Activity 2: Make an outline for a story
- What are the common challenges with historical writing?
  - Discuss presentism, quaintness, etc.
  - Activity 3: Write your own story while avoiding the common challenges (after the end of class)

Additional ideas for follow up activities:

- Collaborate on writing a timeline with compelling claims presented alongside evidence (each student writes an entry on the timeline)
- Write a caption for an old photograph with evocative language, emotional content for historical events

We plan to published the finished version of this presentation on the [Explore Baltimore Heritage 101 course site](http://baltimoreheritage.github.io/explore-101/).

# Introduction

Note:

Writing starts with a good question. Lepore writes: "Good questions come in all shapes and sizes. Very roughly, you can sort yours into two piles:

- One kind is more empirical (what happened?)
- The other is historiographical (what's at stake in the debate among historians about what happened?)

Overall, you should focus on asking:  How do you write for an audience?

---

## Making evidence-based claims

- Show your sources
- Don't assume your sources explain themselves

Note:

Lepore writes: "Show your reader your evidence, whenever you can—quote from the primary documents—but don't assume that those quotations explain themselves; offer a close reading."

--

## Evidence and reasoning

Careful, logical reasoning connects your evidence to specific claims. Ask yourself:

- Is your evidence relevant and accurate?
- Is your evidence sufficient?
- How does your evidence supports your claims?

--

## Let's read some claims

Note:

1. Prepare printed notecards with examples of historical writing about Baltimore. Collect 4-6 examples and print around 5 copies of each. On a separate sheet, list the sources used for each of the examples.
2. Distribute the examples to participants in the class.
3. Ask the participants to read the examples and underline any "claims" they read in the piece. For each claim participants identify, ask if the source clear from the writing? If no, what kind of source do you think they could have used?
5. Review each of the examples as a group revealing the sources the writer used.

--

## Let's write some claims

Note:

1. Take the sources you collected in your research process.
2. Make a list of all of the claims you think the sources can support.
3. Incorporate those claims into a paragraph-length exposition or narrative about the place.

---

## How do you tell a story with a beginning, middle, and an end?

Historians write both **exposition** and **narrative**.

Note:

Lepore explains:

> "Historians tend to write in both expository and narrative modes. In the writing of history, a story without an argument fades into antiquarianism; an argument without a story risks pedantry."

--

### Work from a plan

>"Good work has parts: beginning, middle, and ending... The reader who sees the big parts is more likely to remember to whole story." ~ Roy Peter Clark

Note:

"The best way to illustrate this effect is to reveal the big parts of a short and deceptively simple children's song, "Three Blind Mice." Sing the melody in your head. Now try to name the parts. Part one is a simple musical phrase repeated once. Part two builds on that phrase and adds a beat. Part three adds three equal but more complex phrases. Part four repeats the first phrase, "three blind mice," closing the song into a tight circle."

(Writing Tools, p.119)

--

### Make an outline

- Where does your argument or your story begin, where does it need to go, where has it got to end?
- What sequence of evidence best supports your claims?
- How and where will you engage both with what other people have written about your subject? With broader interpretations of this period in American history?

Note:

Lepore: "If you don't make an outline, you might as well throw your fish back into the water, guts and all."

Stories can be organized in different ways:

- Chronologically
- Thematically

--

### Tell a whole story

> "It is far better to discuss a few aspects well than many aspects superficially." ~ William Cronon

### Beginning

You might want to write your beginning at the end.

How do you start a story?

- Describe a historical event
- Introduce a quotation from a historical source
- Connect to a current event
- Ask a question

Note:

>An standard introduction draws in the reader, establishes the paper's topic, and explains the writer's argument. An excellent introduction goes further: it makes a reader think they have already read the paper!

- Describe a historical event: Some of the best history writing begins with a rich description of a historic moment.
- Introduce a quotation from a historical text: You can never go wrong with a juicy quotation. Plus, doing so shows that you have undertaken primary research.
- Discuss a current event: There is nothing wrong with tying your work to an election, a war, or a World Series. Just make sure the two have more than your paper in common.

Lepore:

> Another very wise historian once said, “You only ever know what you have to say when you think of a title.” I have often found that to be true. A title, though, is mainly an answer to your question, so one way to know it's time to start writing is if a title springs to mind.

Additional tools for beginnings include:

- Questions as story engines (Writing Tools, p. 150-154)
- Foreshadowing (Writing Tools, p. 142-145)

--

### Middle

Reward the reader with high points. Place gold coins along the path.

Readers make predictions for what lies ahead. When readers read chronological narratives, they wonder what will happen next.

Note:

>Imagine you are walking on a narrow path through a deep forest. You stroll a mile, and there at your feet you find a gold coin. You pick it up and put it in your pocket. You walk another mile, and, sure enough, you see another good coin. What will you do next? You walk another mile in search of another coin, of course.

(Writing Tools, p.155)

Other techniques for moving a reader through a story (and sustaining) interest include:

- Internal cliffhangers

--

### Ending

How do you end a story?

- The time frame
- The space frame
- Problem and solution
- The apt quote

Note:

Lepore:

> Lots of essays begin but never end; they merely stop. Make sure to end. It's not over till there's nothing left but the bones, and the smell of the ocean.

Reality is messy but readers seek closure.

- Closing the circle
- The tieback
- The time frame
- The space frame
- The payoff
- The epilogue
- Problem and solution
- The apt quote
- Look into the future
- Mobilize the reader

Remember, other parts of your story need endings too. Sentences have endings. Paragraphs have endings.

--

## Let's outline a story

Pick a place you know well (even if you don't know the history). Write an outline for story about the place.

Note:

1. Ask everyone to pick a place. Pass out blank notecards.
2. Take 5 minutes to write an outline for a story about the place. It should have at least 5 acts to the story. The first is your beginning. The last is your ending.
3. Go around and ask people to share their stories.
4. Discuss: Why did you order the story this way? How did you incorporate the tools we discussed to make good beginnings, middles, and endings?

## Common Challenges

Where do people struggle when writing about the past?

Note:

Depending on how much time is available at this point in the presentation, this section may be an opportunity for discussion or serve as a quick wrap-up to the class.

--

### Accuracy

"No one asked us to be keepers of the flame of history; we've taken it on ourselves. When we choose to write nonfiction, our first commitment is not to be readable or to educate or to curry favor with our readers. It is to be as accurate as possible."

Note:

Melissa Fay Greene highlights anachronism as an error to guard against.

--

### Quaintness

"There wasn't anything quaint about the pilgrims. The past wasn't simpler than the present. People were not kinder or dumber or gentler than they are now. At the same time, don't lapse into a progressive interpretation of history. Things don't always get better over time."

Note:

Source: Writing about History, Jill Lepore (list of  "potential pitfalls") from Narrative Nonfiction

--

### Presentism

"The central point of the story can't be to explain to the reader why were are the way we are today. … Thinking too much about the present will lead you to ask the wrong questions about the past. Take the past on its own terms, not on ours."

Note:

### Passive Voice

The railroad was built.

Note:

> Avoid passive voice.  Examples: Mistakes were made.  The railroad was built.

From [William Cronon](http://www.williamcronon.net/handouts/460_handout_roark_place_paper_faqs.htm):

>The passive voice is when a writer makes the object of a sentence its subject. This causes two major problems in a sentence: it either hides the actor or adds unnecessary words. ...
>Of course, the rules about passive voice use are not absolute. Sometimes, historians cannot identify a specific actor because there are none. When dealing with large, complex forces, historians, such as in the following example, often must use the passive voice to make their case.

From [Who Said That?: or, Why, How, and When to Avoid the Passive Voice](http://history.wisc.edu/historylab_passivevoice.pdf)

--

### Your reader is not an expert

You are not your reader.

Note:

Assume that your reader does not know:

- Where the place is located
- What the place looks like
- How the place may compare to other similar places in your community

## What do you do now?

### Drafting

"Just sit down, either with a pen and paper or at your computer, and start working."

Note:

[Drafting Advice](http://www.williamcronon.net/researching/writing.htm#Drafting)

Options for getting started:

- Try to type your table of contents first. It will give you a structure within which to work.
- try dumping all the stuff from your brain onto the page or screen. Start with the introduction and just free-write and see how it goes. Then you can put all those horrible metaphors and dangling participles into your computer.
- type out all of the quotes you'd like to use. That way, at least you have words on the page or screen, and that sense of accomplishment can be just the thing to get you into the writing groove.
- move to the section you like best, the one that will be easiest for you to write. Grab that gorgeous little pile of note cards and start entering all the most important information in your computer.

---

### Revision

Whatever the case, this exercise below can help you organize your thoughts before you write. If you know what you want to say before you start writing, the process will go much faster and be a lot easier.

Note:

[A Rare Medium: Revising a Paper That is Finished, but not Well Done](http://history.wisc.edu/historylab_revision.pdf)

> “I've never published a word that I hadn't heard going over my tongue because [of] the relationship of one sentence to another sentence. A perfectly good sentence may have to be changed because sentence number two makes it a little awkward rhythmically.... Number three does that to two and one and so on. That's why first drafts are so awful. A significant goal for me is just to hear this thing and I read it generally to my wife…then I go back to work on it, make the rhythm better.”
> —John McPhee, National Public Radio, June 24, 2006

>We tell stories with each other and against each other in order to speak to each other. Our readers, in short, play crucial roles in shaping the stories we tell. Just so has this essay gone through four separate incarnations to reach its present form, each of them responding in different ways to the critical communities that in a very real sense helped author them. No matter how frustrating this process of revision may be, the resulting text is in this case unquestionably better as a result.
>—William Cronon in "A Place for Stories: Nature, History, and Narrative"
