## Explore Baltimore Heritage 101
### How to research historic places

Eli Pousson, [Baltimore Heritage](http://baltimoreheritage.org/) | 2016 June 21

The finished version of this presentation will be published on the [Explore Baltimore Heritage 101 course site](http://baltimoreheritage.github.io/explore-101/).

## Introduction

This presentation begins with three questions that help you **think about the process of researching historic places**:

- What places can you research?
- How do historians think about the past?
- How do historians think about places?

The presentation then tackles in more detail **how to research historic places**:

- How do you ask good research questions?
- How do you search for sources?
- How do you make sense of the evidence you find?

Note: In this presentation, we decided to focus on helping learners understand the research process and the analytical framework used by local historians rather than focusing on how to access to analyze specific sources (like maps or newspapers). We put together a series of **activities** that learners can do on their own or in groups to increase their familiarity with how to use specific types of sources or specific databases.

# Part 1

- What places can you research?
- How do historians think about the past?
- How do historians think about places?

## What places can you research?

1. Individual buildings
2. Groups of buildings
3. Landscapes
4. Public art and monuments

**Think**: How are different places shaped by their  **physical context** (rural, suburban, urban), the **use** (agricultural, commercial, domestic, and industrial), and **age** (very old or very new)?

Note: This section is based on the [Vernacular Architecture Forum downloadable slideshow](http://www.vernaculararchitectureforum.org/Tools-for-Education). Some historians call groups of buildings as "assemblages" of buildings.

Note: Single buildings include houses, commercial buildings, and factories. Other individual structures could include bridges, tunnels, or dams.

Note: Groups of buildings include row house blocks, a row of commercial buildings on a "main street", or a complex of buildings like a church with a parsonage and school.

Note: Public artworks and monuments are not buildings but they are often interesting places to research.

**Activity**: What places can we research?

Before the activity, the facilitator will set up a poster board divided into four quadrants for the four categories of places described above.

1. Write the name and location of a place you want to research on a post-it note. If you have more than one place in mind, please use a new post-it note for each place.
2. Put the post-it notes on the post board in the category where you think they belong. How many post-its are in each category?
3. Think again about the place you want to research. How can you look at an individual building as part of a group or as part of a landscape?
4. Write a second post-it note that incorporates the place you are interested in but places it in another category than the first one.

## How do historians think about the past?

Note: It is helpful to consider how historians think about the past and how we can understand the past. We think it is also important to look at what makes local history different than scholarly or academic history.

### Five C's of Historical Thinking

Thomas Andrews and Flannery Burke suggest looking at the craft of history as a series of "habits of mind" that help you "formulate and support arguments based on primary sources" and "understand and challenge historical interpretations related in secondary sources".

- Change over time
- Context
- Causality
- Contingency
- Complexity

Note: These concepts are designed to help you "learn how to formulate and support arguments based on primary sources, as well as to understand and challenge historical interpretations related in secondary sources." This isn't the only way to think about historical thinking but it is a helpful framework for explaining core concepts. Read more about the five C's of historical thinking in [What Does It Mean to Think Historically?](https://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/january-2007/what-does-it-mean-to-think-historically)

**Activity**: Use these ideas to analyze a historical document.

### How do local historians think about the past?

Local historians may have different goals than scholarly or academic historians. In [Nearby History](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL2987596W/Nearby_History) (2000), David Kyvig and Myron Marty, suggest your goal does not need to be complicated:

> "Often the goal of inquiry is simply an accurate portrayal of of an event, personality, set of conditions, or place at some past moment."

--

### Local History and Scale

David Kyvig and Myron Marty suggest categorizing research questions by subject, ranging from intimate and immediate subjects like _family_ to large and distant subjects like towns or _cities_:

- **Families**: relationships, movement, daily life, public affairs, education
- **Residences**: physical features, ownership, use
- **Neighborhoods**: boundaries, identity, transportation, population
- **Organizations**: businesses, schools, religious groups, voluntary associations
- **Cities**: society, economy, justice, health government

## How do historians think about places?

In the past, architectural historians have often focused on the well-known individual architects or the design of ornate buildings (sometimes known as high-style buildings).

![The Belvedere Hotel, 1 East Chase Street, Baltimore, MD, January 13, 2011](https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5085/5368889506_3abc491639_b.jpg)

Today, many historians interested in buildings study **"vernacular architecture"**—the common buildings that make up most neighborhoods and cities.

--

### What is vernacular architecture?

When you are researching local buildings or neighborhoods, you are often looking at what historians call **vernacular architecture**.  Eric Mercer in English Vernacular Houses (1975) wrote:

> Vernacular architecture is the common building of a given place and time.

Using this flexible definition, historians Thomas Carter and Elizabeth Collins Cromley in [Invitation to Vernacular Architecture](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL17343095W/Invitation_to_Vernacular_Architecture) (2005) suggest organizing your research around the _kind of community_ you are looking at, rather than the specific characteristics of a building.

--

### How do you look at places within a community?

Carter and Cromley divide "vernacular communities" into five categories based on size and scale:

- **Local**: A single location
- **Regional**: Grouping nearby locations with shared cultural traits
- **National**: Cultural patterns defined by national affinities
- **International**: Cultural cores and their peripheries
- **Global**: Worldwide diffusion of culture

These categories are _not_ mutually exclusive.

--

### How do you analyze places?

Research isn't just about finding sources or collecting evidence. Research is about **analysis**: the process of trying to answer your research questions.

Carter and Cromley suggest five approaches for analyzing vernacular architecture:

- Time
- Space
- Form
- Function
- Technology

Note: These approaches are the "point at which the architectural and archival evidence join to reveal the **patterns of behavior** that are the goal of the research process." They require you to combine different kinds of evidence:

> "These two bodies of evidence—words and things—interweave to yield a composite portrait of the patterns of behavior we seek to uncover."

See Carter and Cromley, p. 45-47 for more.

# Part 2

- How do you ask good research questions?
- How do you search for sources?
- How do you make sense of the evidence you find?

---

## How do you ask good research questions?

Often your challenge is not coming up with a question, it is deciding which question to start with.

In [Nearby History](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL2987596W/Nearby_History) (2000), David Kyvig and Myron Marty observe:

> Nearly everyone is surrounded by a vast assortment of people, objects, and institutions, each with potentially interesting past about which an enormous amount of information exists in one form or another.

**Activity**: What do my neighbors think?

1. Think of a research question about a historic places in your neighborhood.
2. Share the research question on a neighborhood Facebook group, email listserv, or

--

### What is the purpose of a question for historians?

Kyvig and Marty suggest that historical questions should have answers that include:

- A description of the past
- Measurement of change over time
- An analysis of cause and consequence

---

## How do you search for sources?

- Determine what sources are **available** and **relevant**
- Develop a **search strategy** based around search queries or keywords
- Evaluate the **credibility** of your sources continuously

--

### Availability and relevance

--

### Searching with key words

How to come up with key words:

- Write your research questions
- Turn research questions into keywords
- Choose nouns instead of verbs (sometimes)

How to search with keywords:

- Start with general keywords
- Try new combinations systematically
- Use more precise terms as you progress
- Pair primary keywords serially with secondary keywords

What do you do if your first choice doesn't work?

--

### Evaluate the credibility of sources

---

## How do you make sense of the evidence you find?

---

# Activities

One way to practice and develop your local history research skills is by contributing to a larger crowd-sourced project:

- [History Unfolded](https://newspapers.ushmm.org/), U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum: Build your expertise in finding events in historic newspaper databases by volunteering to research how local newspapers covered the Holocaust and then submit the articles you find to the History Unfolded online database.
- [Building Inspector](http://buildinginspector.nypl.org/), New York Public Library Labs: Build your understanding of historical atlases by volunteering as a citizen cartographers for the New York Public Library identifying buildings and other details on beautiful old maps

Another way to practice is

- [Two Houses Diverged in a Neighborhood](https://gist.github.com/elipousson/e742d3efbf1d620d3b196b76b6a132c5), Eli Pousson

## How do you think about the research process?

One way of looking at the research process is the Stripling Model of Inquiry:

1. Wonder: How do you come up with a question?
2. Investigate: How do you search for sources?
3. Construct: How do you use primary sources?
4. Express: How do you share your research?
5.  Reflect: How do you ask new questions?
6. Connect: How do you put your research in context?

Note: There are many different ways to describe the research process. These categories are based on the [Stripling Model of Inquiry](http://loc.gov/teachers/tps/quarterly/inquiry_learning/pdf/StriplingModelofInquiry.pdf).
